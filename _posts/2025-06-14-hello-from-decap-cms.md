[Decap CMS](https://decapcms.org/) (formerly Netlify CMS) is an open-source, Git-based content management system that provides a user-friendly admin interface for static site generators. It allows non-technical users to manage content through a web-based editor while storing all content as files in a Git repository, maintaining version control and enabling developer-friendly workflows.
